     Echo of Death. — Sugisaki Ken

    That night, I realised one more thing. My definition of dirty and Ringo's definition of dirty are worlds apart. — Sugisaki Ken

    Chii? — Chii

    There are no people in this city. I will leave this city and go to another one. I hope that I will meet someone. Someone just for me. — Atashi

[Fate/stay night]
    People die when they are killed. — Emiya Shirou

    I am the bone of my sword. Steel is my body, and fire is my blood. I have created over a thousand blades. Unknown to death. Nor known to life. Have withstood pain to create many weapons. Yet, those hands will never hold anything. So as I pray, Unlimited Blade Works. — Archer

    The weakness that had accepted death now became the strength of wanting to live. — Shirou Emiya

    The things we can't obtain are the most beautiful ones. — Gilgamesh

    Eternity is instantaneous, and an instant is eternal. — Archer

    Righteousness cannot save the world. — Emiya Kiritsugu

    Idiot?! You know you're an idiot, yet you still call me an idiot?! You idiot! — Shirou Emiya

[Fate/Zero]
    To win, but not destroy; to conquer, but not humiliate: That is what true conquest is! — Iskander

    There’s no hope on the battlefield. It has nothing but unspeakable despair. Just a crime we call victory, paid for by the pain of the defeated. Yet humanity has never recognized this truth. And the reason for that is, in every era, a dazzling hero has blinded people with their legends and prevented them from seeing the evil of bloodshed. The true nature of humanity has not advanced a step beyond the Stone Age. — Kiritsugu Emiya

    Then you swear that, once I defeat an enemy, you will buy me pants? — Rider

    You really can’t trust books when you don’t know who wrote them. — Rider

    The path of devotion is a great labor. Do not ever mar it. — Gilgamesh

    Did you not understand? All dreams eventually disappear when the dreamers wake. — Gilgamesh

    When you someday find a way of life that you can truly be proud of, you'll be forced into your own battle whether you like it or not. — Rider

    The weight of my sword is the weight of my pride. The wound from my battle with you is an honor, not a fetter. — Saber

    Conflict is humanity's primal instinct. Eliminating it would mean eliminating humanity itself. — Kotomine Kirei

    A king must be greedier, laugh louder, and be more furious than everyone else. — Rider

    To unite dreams under a banner of conquest. I praise your efforts. But, warriors, did you not understand? That all dreams must disappear when the dreamer awakes. Every last one of them. Therefore it was inevitable that I would stand in your way. King of Conquerors, know the end of your eternal dream. I, myself, shall show you this harsh reality. — Gilgamesh

[Clannad]
    The world is beautiful. Even if you’re full of tears and sadness, open your eyes. Do what you want to do. Be what you want to be. Find friends. Don’t be in a hurry to grow up. Take your time. — Ichinose Kotomi’s parents

    We didn’t give up on our dreams! We changed our dreams into your dream! That’s what parents do! That’s what family does! — Akio Furukawa

    The day before yesterday, I saw a rabbit. Yesterday, it was a deer. And today, it’s you. — Ichinose Kotomi

    No matter how cold and distant people may become, on the inside something warm and precious always remains, something that never changes. To me, that’s what family is like. — Sakagami Tomoyo

    I like you better than a sea slug. I like the sea slug fairly well, so be happy. — Fuko Ibuki

    Life can bring lots of hardships, but it's always important to keep in mind that there are people around you who care for you, and are willing to help you through whatever you're dealing with. — Nagisa Furukawa

    If you wish, would you like me to take you? To a place in this city where wishes come true. — Nagisa Furukawa

    We start to walk up... the long... long.. uphill climb. — Tomoya Okazaki

    Anpan — Nagisa Furukawa

    Make your dreams come true, Nagisa! — Akio Furukawa

    Sanae-san told me, places that I can cry are in a toilet, or in daddy's arms. — Okazaki Ushio

    Are you a bully? — Kotomi Ichinose

    Next time, come in on all fours, so I know you're not a customer. — Furukawa Akio

    Nagisa-chan and Okazaki? What are you two doing in my room? You weren't possibly going to... ...make this your nest of love?! — Youhei Sunohara

    You should cry while you still can. When you get bigger, sometimes, you can't cry even if you have something you wanna cry about. — Okazaki Tomoya

    This is a world that has ended. Nothing is born; nothing dies. Even time does not exist. If I were searching for a place to be born, then I realized it should not be here. — Garbage Doll

    I am horrible! Wait, that makes Fuko the horrible one! — Fuko Ibuki

    No! Fuko is sure you couldn't resist wearing them! The world would end because of you! — Fuko Ibuki

    Love is like a firework from the past... it's more beautiful for it to go to pieces and scatter far off. — Katsuki Shima

    Time and titles do not matter in the bonds between people. — Tomoyo Sakagami

    No matter how depressing a place may look, the most important places don't change. I think there's a similar aspect to family, as well. — Sakagami Tomoyo

    My name is Fujibayashi Kyou. A senior in class E. My hobby is bullying weaklings. I would be happy if you would become my friend — Kyou Fujibayashi

    At this moment, Sunohara had yet to realize he had begun to walk the path of the pervert. — Tomoya Okazaki

    Fuko is utterly shocked! — Fuko Ibuki

[Clannad: After Story]
    If you feel like crying you shouldn’t hold back your tears. You should let it all out while you still can, because when you get bigger sometimes you can’t cry even if you have something to cry about. — Tomoya Okazaki

    Meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me. You made me so happy. I don’t want you to be lost or afraid or anything like that. From here on out, I know things might be hard sometimes. But no matter what, please don’t ever regret the time we spent together. — Nagisa Furukawa

    Shall I take you away, to the place where dreams come true? — Furukawa Nagisa

    Sanae-san told me the only places I can cry are in the bathroom and in Daddy's arms. — Ushio Okazaki

    We have sex and sex makes babies! — Nagisa Furukawa

    Nagisa, I found it. I finally found it. Something only I can protect. The precious thing only i can protect. It was... right here. — Tomoya Okazaki

    Tomoya, Nagisa isn’t just our daughter, she’s our hope. So I want you to know that today, you’re part of that hope, too. So never forget that your happiness is our happiness as well. In other words, try your best to be happy, okay? — Sanae Furukawa

    All that, and a toilet! — Youhei Sunohara

    I was worried that you were thinking about how you should've never met me. — Nagisa Furukawa

    If a prediction is right, then it’s like you have one future. Like that future has been decided. But if it’s wrong, then you have an almost infinite number of possibilities, and that the tiniest twist of fate can change your future. I want to believe that I have choices, that the path I walk on has different turns, and many different roads to follow. — Ryou Fujibayashi

    He realized that he had lost sight of something important. No matter what turn he took he should have kept singing. Even if his songs couldn’t save the world, he could still sing songs for her. Don’t ever lose sight of what’s important to you.— Yusuke Yoshino

    There are things a man has to protect even if it kills his pride. — Akio Furukawa

    Will you marry me? — Tomoya Okazaki

    I can't even grant the one wish my only daughter has? — Tomoya Okazaki

    Love is like a firework from the past… it’s more beautiful for it to go to pieces and scatter far off. — Katsuki Shima

    Mommy was a crybaby. — Tomoya Okazaki

    This is the best gift I can give you right now. A gift without form called memory. I don't have money. I can't buy you anything with form. Even so, even without form, a memory will last forever! I believe that it will. — Yusuke Yoshino

    You lit the fire in my heart. Like the FIREBALL!! — Akki

    If you were in my shoes....could you do that? Could you think like that? When you like that person so much! Could you think of it as an opportunity when the person is broken-hearted? — Shima Kastsuki

    I'm glad that i met you, I had a wonderful life, So please don't lose yourself, No matter what may await please don't regret meeting me. — Nagisa Furukawa

    That's sounds wonderful. May I call you Galactic-san? — Furukawa Sanae

    Yu. You're a seed from a flower. You'll be blown away by the wind and start your journey. You're on your way to meet new people in new places. You can't be spoiled by your sister anymore. Even if you're apart, you're still connected by a bond. That's what family is! — Youhei Sunohara

[Clannad: Another World, Tomoyo Chapter]
    I've already decided.Getting good grades and listening to teachers can take me somewhere high and far away.But what if that's not where I want to go? Right here by your side Tomoya is the only place I want to be! — Tomoyo Sakagami

[Clannad: Another World, Kyou Chapter]
    If you apologize and I accept your apology, it'll feel like all of this was a joke. I want to make those times a memory. All the fun times. All the hard times. All of them. So please, don't apologize. — Ryou Fujibayashi

[Angel Beats!]
    Our lives were real! Not a single moment of them were fake! Everyone lived the best they could! We carved those memories into ourselves! Memories of living as hard as we could! No matter what kind they were, they’re the life we led! Erasing them in the blink of an eye like that… Wasn’t your life also real to you?! — Otonashi Yuzuru

    Goodbye wild heaven! — TK

    Get chance and luck! — TK

    Even death can't cure idiocy. — Yui

    Knockin' on heaven's door. — TK

    I put a propulsion engine under your seat just in case you messed up. — Yuri Nakamura

    Even if we forget the faces of our friends, we will never forget the bonds that were carved into our souls. — Yuzuru

    Even if you can’t walk or stand, or even if you can’t have kids! I’ll still marry you! I’ll always stay by your side. The Yui I met here isn’t fake. It’s the real Yui. No matter where or how I meet you, I’ll fall in love with you. If I can meet you again, against the 6 billion to 1 odds, and even if your body can’t move, I’ll marry you. — Hinata Hideki

    Kanade, I love you so much. Let's be together forever. Together, forever and ever! — Yuzuru Otonashi

    If I lost my memories…and got a different personality…I might be able to. But then, what does it mean to be reborn? That isn’t the life I had anymore. It’s someone else’s life. Everyone only gets to live life one time, and it’s right here. I only get it once. This is my life. I can’t entrust it to someone, I can’t steal a new one, I can’t force it on others, I can’t forget it or erase it. I can’t stomp over it, laugh on it, or beautify it! I can’t anything! I’d have to-I’d have to accept my one shot at life no matter how cruel, merciless, or unfair I thought it was! Sir, don’t you understand? That is why I must fight. I must keep on fighting! Because…because I can never… accept that kind of life! — Yuri Nakamura

    Oh man, my heart is pounding! I'm eating snacks in the middle of class! I ate it! I totally ate it! Boldly eating snacks in the middle of class! I'm so reckless! — Ooyama

    That's why I'm singing, Because you are crying because you are lonely, You are right you are human, The tears you shed are saying "Thank you for the beautiful, real me, That is not just some lie" — Iwasawa Masami (My song)

    Now, disapear like the pathetic toilet paper you are. — Naoi Ayato

    Hurry up! You can make it! Oh, run to her and hug her tight! — TK

    Hey, why does this situation look like something at the end of a shonen manga?! — Hinata Hideki

    How shallow-minded — Shiina

    All I wanted to hear was her "thank you" — Yuzuru Otonashi

    You got away with just physical damage, but I'm going to take CRITICAL MENTAL DAMAGE! — Ooyama

    Me? I always do my own thing. I won't be protecting you guys. I just do whatever I want. — Yuri Nakamura

    But please, call me Christ. — Takeyama

    Messing around at night together... This calls for punishment. — Tachibana Kanade

[Angel Beats!: Another Epilogue]
    You have something you want to do, right? What do you need to accomplish that? What do you need right now? Answer me! One person needed courage to face the past. Another person needed effort to make a dream come true. Yet another person needed time and friends. What about you? — Yuzuru Otonashi

    Then hurry up and do it instead of whining. — Yuzuru Otonashi

[5 Centimeters per Second]
    The speed at which the sakura blossom petals fall... Five centimeters per second. — Akari Shinohara

    The things I had to tell her, the things I hoped she would listen to... There were so many of them. — Takaki Tohno

    I wonder when I got into the habit of writing messages to nobody. — Takaki Tohno

    At what speed must I live to be able to see you again? — Takaki Tohno

    Through the act of living itself, sadness piles up here and there. Whether in the sheets hung to dry in the sun, the single toothbrush in your bathroom or the history logs of your cell phone. — Takaki Toono

    'Someday we will be able to watch the cherry blossoms together again'. Both of us, without any doubt... That's what we thought. — Akari Shinohara and Takaki Tohno

    Every minute felt like an eternity time, clearly as if it had malicious intent, slowly ebbed away from me, I clenched my teeth and keeping myself from crying was the only thing i could do… — Takaki Toono

    Desperatly, reaching recklessly towards the sky. In search of something almost overwhelmingly far off in the distance. — Takaki Toono

    Will I Ever Meet That Person I love Again ? — Akari Shinohara

    And right then it felt like I finally understood where everything was, eternity, the heart , the soul. It was like I was sharing every experience I’d ever had in my past 13 years. And then, the next moment, I became unbearably sad. I didn’t know what to do with these feeling. Her warmth, her soul. How was I supposed to treat them? That, I did not know. Then right then, I clearly understood that we would never be together. Our lives not yet fully realized, the vast expanse of time. They lay before us and there was nothing we could do. But then, all my worries, all my doubt, started melting away. All that was left were Akari’s soft lips on mine. — Takaki Toono

[Tsubasa Chronicle]
    The world you can see isn’t all out there. In the world there are alot of fascinating things that no living soul has ever seen! And just in knowing that is one cause for happiness. I’m sure you can find happiness meant for you! It might be something you might not quite understand yet. But you’ll find it, that much is certain! — Fujitaka Kinomoto

    Don't look back. If you got something to do, then only look forward — Kurogane

[Bleach]
    We are all like fireworks. We climb, shine, and always go our separate ways and become further apart. But even if that time comes, let’s not disappear like a firework, and continue to shine forever. — Hitsugaya Toushiro

    Remember this well. There are two types of fights. As we have put our lives in battle, we must be able to distinguish between the two. The fight to protect life, and the fight to protect pride. — Ukitake Jushir

    BANKAI! — Ichigo Kurosaki

    You humans are always talking about hearts. It’s as if you have them in your hand. But my eye sees everything. Nothing can escape it. What it doesn't see doesn't exist. That’s how I've always thought. What is a heart? If I rip open your chest, will I find it there? If I crack open your skull, will I find it there? — Ulquiorra Schiffer

    Abandon your fear. Look forward. Move forward and never stop. You'll age if you pull back. You'll die if you hesitate. — Zangetsu

    I do not fight because I think I can win. I fight because I have to win. — Ichigo Kurosaki

    Unless I grip the sword, I cannot protect you. While gripping the sword, I cannot embrace you. — Ichigo Kurosaki

    There is nothing in this world that is truly "perfect". Though it may be a rather large cliché, it is still the truth. It is the ordinary people who look up to "perfection" as an ideal and seek after it. But in truth, what is this idea of "perfection" truly worth? Nothing. Not a single thing. I detest "perfection". To be "perfect" is to be unable to improve any further. There would be no scope for imagination, not a single gap in one's knowledge or one's ability. Do you see now? To true scientists like you and I, "Perfection" is tantamount to "despair". We aspire to reach greater levels of brilliance than ever before, but never, NEVER, to reach perfection. That is the paradox through which we scientists must struggle. Indeed, it is our duty to find pleasure in that struggle. In other words, the second you allowed yourself to spout a ridiculous word like "perfect", in truth, you had already been defeated. That is if you wish to be treated as a scientist. — Mayuri Kurotsuchi

    A man who raises his hands on a woman is trash. If I have to become trash in order to survive... It'll be just like dying. — Renji Abarai

    Ichigo, what's the difference between a king and his horse? I don't mean kiddy shit like "One's a person and one's an animal" or "One has two legs and one has four." If their form, ability and power were exactly the same, why is it that one becomes the king and controls the battle, while the other becomes the horse and carries the king?! There's only one answer. Instinct! In order for identical beings to get stronger and gain the power they need to become king, they must search for more battles and power! They thirst for battle, and live to mercilessly, crush, shred, and slice their enemies! Deep, deep within our body lies the honed instinct to kill, and slaughter our enemies! But you don't have that! You don't have those pure, base instincts! You fight with your brain. You try to defeat your enemies with logic! And it doesn't work! You're trying to cut them with a sheathed sword! That's why you're weaker than me, Ichigo! — Shirosaki

    I’m literally hemorrhaging generosity. — Zaraki Kenpachi

    If you were to turn into a snake tomorrow and begin devouring humans, and from the same mouth you started devouring humans, you cried out to me 'I love you,' would I still be able to say 'I love you' the same way I do today? — Gin Ichimaru

    Emotions? Nope, I've got nothin' like that. I told you when we first met, didn't I? I'm a snake. With cold skin, no emotions, that slithers around searching for prey with its tongue, swallowing down whatever looks tasty. — Gin Ichimaru

    Trusting in someone is the same as depending on them. That is something the weak do. We have no use for it. — Sousuke Aizen

    I'm not superman, so I can't say anything big like I'll protect everyone on earth. I'm not a modest guy who will say it's enough if I can protect as many people as my two hands can handle either. I want to protect a mountain-load of people. — Ichigo Kurosaki

    You know why big brothers are born first? To protect the little ones that come after them — Ichigo Kurosaki

    With your ability, you will find it impossible to make me fall on even one knee. — Byakuya Kuchiki

    Sanity...what would i do with a useless thing like that. — Zaraki Kenpachi

    The betrayal you can see is trivial. What is truly fearsome, is the betrayal that you don't see, Captain Hirako. — Sousuke Aizen

    I'M NOT AN ELEMENTARY STUDENT!!! — Hitsugaya Toushirou

    If miracles only happen once, what are they called the second time? — Ichigo Kurosaki

    I'm not gonna have it, Ichigo. I don't know about Zangetsu, but I refuse to carry a king who's weaker than me and get cut to ribbons with him. If you're weaker than me, then I'll destroy you, and take your crown for myself. — Shirosaki

    Beautiful Charlotte Chuhlhourne's Perfect Stylish Dangerous Psychedelic Valuable Economical Continental Incredible Unbelievable Shining ATTACK! — Charlotte Chuhlhourne

    There is no individual sense of justice that can overrule the justice of the world. — Genryusai Yamamoto

    Never admit defeat and ask for a quick death! Die first, then admit defeat! If you are defeated but didn't die, it just means you were lucky! At those times, think only about survival! Survive and think only about killing the one who failed to kill you! — Kenpachi Zaraki

    In a battle, the ones who get in the way are not the ones that lack power, but the ones that lack resolve. — Rukia Kuchiki

    I'm so disappointed, Ichigo, so very disappointed. Sadly, your sword exhibits only fear. When you counter, it's because you fear being killed. When you attack, you fear killing. And when you protect someone, you fear you could let them die. At this point, the only thing your sword speaks is senseless fright, and that's not good. What you don't need in battle is fear. Nothing will come of it. When you attack, you don't let them cut you. When you protect someone, you don't let them die. And when you attack, you kill. — Kisuke Urahara

    In my eyes, there is no difference between wiping away one speck of dust or two. — Sousuke Aizen

    Ideals of perfection doesn't exist. What exists of the following ideas is the discovery that these things are impossible to realize, the loss of hope. But it is with despair that can reach your greatest hidden power. It is the despair that breaks its limits. Frees his heart to act as you wish. Who has the power is going to dictate the rules! Even if that power is black and ugly. By winning, this blackness becomes the color of real justice! — Kouga Kuchiki

    I cannot begin to repay the debts I owe you. Such is my gratitude. However, you are an enemy of Ichigo Kurosaki. Debt or not, I feel no remorse in cutting you down. — Byakuya Kuchiki

    You thought you could destroy me by striking with power? How naive. ...No, perhaps we differ in our basic understandings of the word "power". I shall enlighten you. This is what is known as "power". — Sousuke Aizen

    It’s always a lot easier to let something fall apart than it is to try to hold it together. — Yumichika Ayasegawa

    I've decided. I'm going to become a Shinigami. Become a Shinigami and change things. So that they'll end...without Rangiku having to cry. — Gin Ichimaru

    To fight...Or to live...Choose. — Zangetsu

    Death and pain are just a small price to pay for the enjoyment of battle! — Zaraki Kenpachi

    Dammit, I'll show you who's more skilled with his language skills! — Kurosaki Ichigo

    Though you fight a fierce battle on the outside, your inner world trembles not the slightest. — Zangetsu

    You must never die alone. We entrust our hearts to our friends. If you entrust your heart to your friends it will continue to live on inside them. — Kaien Shiba

    "Control"... you say? When you stand before me... that word holds no meaning. Bankai. Senbonzakura Kageyoshi. — Kuchiki Byakuya

    I hate perfection. To be perfect is to be unable to improve any further. — Kurotsuchi Mayuri

    Don't use such strong words -- It makes your weakness all the more apparent. — Sousuke Aizen

    Blah blah blah! You're noisy! Just come on and fight already. It's best if all four of you come together. If you four surround me and attack at once, maybe one of you will actually wound me. — Kenpachi Zaraki

    "You want a reason...for fighting? Why don't you just accept it already! You seek out fights. You desire power. Isn't that right, Ichigo? — Kenpachi Zaraki

    Farewell, warrior of the sky. I would appreciate it if you would not forgive me. — Izuru Kira

    What a punchline, no... that was just a punch. — Tatsuki Arisawa

    You're slow, even when you're falling. — Kuchiki Byakuya

    Desiring power is dangerous. — Kuchiki Kouga

    Ken-Chan! — Kusajishi Yachiru

    The name is Ichigo. I'm the one who's gonna beat your ass. How's it going? — Ichigo Kurosaki

    Feel the wrath of my blade! — Ichigo Kurosaki

    Laws exist only for those who cannot live without clinging to them. — Sousuke Aizen

    As if I care about what becomes of the things you want to protect. Make no mistake, Ichigo. The things that you wish to protect are not the things that I want to protect — Zangetsu

    Abandon your fear. Look forward. Move forward and never stop. You'll age if you pull back. You'll die if you hesitate. — Zangetsu

    Unless I grip the sword, I cannot protect you. While gripping the sword, I cannot embrace you — Ichigo Kurosaki

    I do not fight because I think I can win. I fight because I have to win. — Ichigo Kurosaki

[Soul Eater]
    FOOLS! — Excalibur

    A sound soul dwells within a sound mind, and a sound body. — Maka Albarn

    Do you want to know where the real hell is hiding? It’s inside your head. — Crona

    I do not deny evil, nor do I believe that any human is completely free of malice. Everything must be in balance. As long as evil and good maintain an equilibrium in this world there is no problem. Perfect balance is the key to everything. — Death The Kid

    I'd rather trust and regret than doubt and regret. — Kazuto Kirigaya

    You know, if you married someone, that means you love every side of your significant other that you know already. So if you find a new side after to love, doesnt that mean you’ll love your partner even more? — Kirito

    Levels are just numbers. In this world, strength is just an illusion. — Kazuto Kirigaya

    Just so we're clear, I'm a solo player. One or two days of being orange means nothing to me. — Kazuto Kirigaya

    The main reason I got stronger was so I’d be able to survive. — Kazuto Kirigaya

    Life isn’t so bad. It’s not so bad. — Nishida

    A weak weapon...it's light, without any reach. But it's more than enough to kill you! — Kazuto Kirigaya

    A person is very strong when he seeks to protect something. I’ll expect a good fight. — Heathcliff

    It's time to finish this fight. Between the king of thieves and a gilded hero! — Kazuto Kirigaya

    I cried alone every single night. It felt like every day that passed here stole another piece of my real life away. After i cried, I’d go and fight as hard as I could. My only thought was winning, moving forward, and getting stronger. — Asuna Yuuki

    I’d rather stay myself until the very end than sit and rot away at an inn, back in the first town. Even if I get killed by a monster, I don’t want to lose to this game…to this world… No matter what! — Asuna Yuuki

    Your attacks have no soul...the blades in that world hit harder. They hurt far more! — Kazuto Kirigaya

    Rather than leaving someone to die, I'd much rather die together with them. — Kirigaya Kazuto

    Beater, huh? Sounds good to me. — Kirito

    I was just dreaming a little. About my old world. It’s strange… In the dream, I wondered if everything here, in Aincrad, if everything that had happened with you, was only a dream. I was really scared. I’m happy this wasn’t a dream. — Asuna Yuuki

    Never. I'll never let anyone in my party die as long as I'm standing. That's the last thing I'd let happen! — Kazuto Kirigaya

    I'm sorry, but i have a request. I don't plan on losing. But if I die here, I wan't you to make sure Asuna can't kill herself, just for a little while. — Kazuto Kirigaya

    My life is yours, Asuna. So I'll live for your sake. Until the very end, let's be together! — Kazuto Kirigaya

    Regardless of what may come, I will send you back to the real world. — Kazuto Kirigaya

    LINK START! — Kazuto Kirigaya

    If you'd rather settle this with swords, that's fine by me — Kazuto Kirigaya

    "It hurts"? This is nothing compared to the pain you've inflicted upon Asuna! — Kazuto Kirigaya

    Star Burst Stream!!! — Kirito

    There's no meaningful difference between a real and a virtual world. It's pointless to ask anyone who they really are. All you can do is accept and believe in them. — Kazuto Kirigaya

    I won´t forgive you until you buy me a meal on the other side! — Klein

    Asuna. Today... Tonight, I want to be with you. — Kazuto Kirigaya

    I'm not interested in ordinary menus. — Konata Izumi

    Whenever people are training their dogs, I hear them say “chin-chin” all the time – what’s that mean? — Hiiragi Tsukasa

    You can't move others hearts, unless you can move your own. — Kazuki Fujisawa

    Everyday was the same. Deep down, I felt bored. I wanted to blame someone for my being bored. — Sorata Kanda

    Panties aren't powerful enough to solve all the problems we've go here — Sorata Kanda

    This area feels weird, it's been throbbing hard since that time. When you told me not to go. When you held me so tight. It won't go away. Your voice is still in my ear. What happened to me? Is this...love? — Mashiro Shiina

    What color do you want to be? — Mashiro Shiina

    No panties, no life! — Misaki Kamiigusa

    I'm not stupid. I'm just too lazy to show how smart I am. — Houtarou Oreki

    A database can't draw conclusions. — Satoshi Fukube

    A joke only lasts a moment; if it leaves a misunderstanding, it becomes a lie. — Satoshi Fukube

    If you can never get angry at anything, that probably means you have nothing that you like, either. — Chitanda eru

    We don't know if trying our best will help, but we do know, that if we don't try our best, it won't help for sure! — Chitanda Eru

    A student will only get called to staff room for something bad........by my experience. — Houtarou Oreki

[Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica]
    If you ever feel like dying to help the universe, just let me know. I'll be waiting. — Kyuubey

    Don’t forget. Always, somewhere, someone is fighting for you. As long as you remember that, you are not alone. — Madoka Kaname

    If it’s for your sake, I have no problem being trapped in this maze for eternity. — Akemi Homura

    Protect the one thing you want to protect until the end. — Kyouko

    With kindness comes naïveté. Courage becomes foolhardiness. And dedication has no reward. If you can't accept any of that, you are not fit to be a magical girl. — Homura Akemi

    If someone tells me that it's wrong to have hope, I would tell them that they're wrong. I would keep saying that forever, as many times as necessary — Madoka Kaname

    Miracles aren't free. When you wish for hope, it creates an equivalent despair. That is how the balance of this world is preserved. — Kyouko Sakura

    Make a contract with me, and become a magical girl! — Kyuubey

    It begins with a prayer and ends with a curse — Kyuubey

    You shouldn't want to be like me, I'm just trying to act cool. No matter how scary it is, how hard it is, I can't talk to anyone about it. I always cry alone. Being a Magical Girl isn't good at all. — Mami Tomoe

    Hey...How about we become monsters together...and lay waste to this awful world? We'll wipe out everything...all traces of evil or sadness...and just destroy, destroy, destroy...until there's nothing left but dust. — Homura Akemi

    I was stupid... So stupid... — Sayaka Miki

    Why is it that when humans regret the decision based on a misunderstanding they feel resentment toward the other party? — Kyubee

    On this planet, you call females that have yet to become adults, girl. It makes sense then, since you'll eventually become witches, to call you magical girls. — Kyuubey

    Kindness can bring you even bigger troubles. — Akemi Homura

    If you're just living for your own sake, it's all up to you. No hard feelings. No regrets. — Sakura Kyouko

    I'll repeat it. I'll continue to repeat it over and over. Visiting the same time again and again, searching for the single exit out. Searching for the path to save you from a fate of despair. — -Homura, Akemi

    Even though I've lost my way, I will save you. — Akemi Homura

    All right, here comes my poser phrase. — Hidenori Tabata

    If you don't die right now, I'll kill you! If you don't wanna get killed, then die! — Tadakuni's younger sister

    Those aren’t tears of sadness. They’re tears of happiness, right? Let us make haste, lest the wind ceases. — Hidenori Tabata

    I've been punched by a girl at a riverside before! — Tadakuni

    Any problems with high school boys can generally be traced back to their mothers. Because they were originally part of their mothers. — Yoshitake Tanaka

    But, the wind… is ever so softly weeping. — Yassan

    This is an anime about normal everyday life! Mobile suits and tales of adventure don’t come into it! — Tadakuni

    I don’t know exactly what I won, but I won! — Ringo

    This is bad. I’m surrounded by older girls. At this rate… I’ll be toyed with. — Motoharu

    I ate Twitter. — Tanaka, Yoshitake

    My everyday life with my idiotic, hopeless, and self-conscious friends still continues! — Tadakuni

    Right, I have something I have to apologize to Mitsuo for. Sometimes, when we were playing, you’d suddenly start crying, and then you’d run home. You probably thought you’d fooled us, but everyone knew… that you had pooped your pants! Sorry. — Motoharu

    Why did you fall for the same trick twice?! Are you retarded?! — Yoshitake Tanaka

    I’ve been reading manga lately. In everything I read, some kids around our age are thrown into some bloody battle. What about us? Nothing’s really happened, right? — Hidenori Tabata

    Are you listening, you Salmonella bacteria? — Yanagin

    There's no point if you don't equip your weapon. — Hidenori Tabata

    The world has finally bugged out. — Shiro and Sora

    Throughout all of history, no wise king has ever forced his army to obey him through oppression. People will only truly fight for what is right. And there is only one thing that is truly right in this world! The one true, unchanging righteousness in the world is... cuteness! Cute makes right! All our needs, desires, and instincts seek cuteness, and it is for cuteness that we will give everything we have! That's just the way men are! — Sora

    This world is just… a crappy game. — Shiro and Sora

    "In reality, the least interesting answer is usually the correct one." — ~Narrator

    "What kind of king makes his men fight at the front line while he sits behind them relaxing?" — Sora

    Cute makes Right! — Sora

    When it comes to war and killing, we have far more expertise than you do. — Sora

    Whether were up against elves or god, blank never loses — Sora

    I used to be a gamer like you. Then I took and arrow in the knee... — Sora

    You're not allowed to quit while you're ahead. — Shiro

    Only an idiot starts a fight he can't win. — Sora

    Hey, Shiro. They say people can change, but is that really true? If they decide they want to fly, will they grow wings? I don't think so. You don't change yourself. You change how you do things. You have to make your own way. You have to create a way to fly, even while you stay the same. Let's think of a way to make wings that will let you fly. We can take our time. — Sora

    I don't believe in humanity. Humans are lowly, stupid creatures. Every single one of them. Including me. — Sora

[Isshuukan Friends]
    Math is like a puzzle, or a game. There's one answer, and you're going on an adventure to find it. But there's many differient paths you can take, so it's really rewarding when you reach the goal. Sometimes, it takes a bit of insight. Other times, you can craft your own method. Even the most convulted methods can get you to the answer. No matter how ugly your solution may be, the fact that you constructed something yourself is something to be proud of. — Fujimiya Kaori

    You were in your sister's room, using your sister's computer to play a game about doing indecent things to your sister? — Kousaka Daisuke

    It's way beyond that level. Tsun 100%, dere 0% — Kirino Kousaka

    What are you talking about, dear mother? Look at this screen, with its clear skies as clean as my heart! — Kyousuke Kousaka

    Human relationships come with trouble included. — Saori Makishima

    This world is full of things that defy all common sense. — Kousaka Kyousuke

    Thank god for the emergency escape Key! — Kyousuke Kousaka

    I like homos! I like them a lot! I love them! — Kōhei Akagi

    You're a fake. You see, my sister would never wake me up or cook breakfast or do my laundry. In fact, she completely looks down on me and treats me like an idiot, or outright ignores me! She doesn't listen to a word I say! There's no way she'd come into my room like this to make me up! Basically, what I'm trying to say is... There's no way my sister can be this cu... — Kyousuke Kousaka

[Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?]
    If i die make me a penguin. I like penguins. — King of the night

    Most people live their lives without ever realizing it. — Ayumu Aikawa

    I like the "Swallow Reversal" secret sword technique. I am skilled at using the "Swallow Reversal" secret sword technique. My whole life was the "Swallow Reversal" secret sword technique. — Seraphim

    That's interesting. Don't do it again. — Eucliwood Hellscythe

    By the way, I'm a zombie. — Ayumu Aikawa

    Nomobuyo, Oshi, Hashitawa, Dokeda, Gunmīcha, Dē Ribura! — Haruna

    The beauty of the stars never changes. However, stars that change are beautiful as well. — Eucliwood Hellscythe

    I mean, chicks are cool for some things. You know what I'm talking about? But I'm in the mood for a bro job — Orito

    I'm a genius magical garment girl remember — Haruna

    They say that idiocy can only be cured by death. I was an idiot. Boredom might be a luxury, but it’s no fun. Loneliness might be peace, but then you cannot share your joy with others… thank you. My life changed because you killed me. — Ayumu Aikawa

    This choking sensation is to die for! — Haruna

[Ro-Kyu-Bu!]
    Elementary schoolers are the best! — Subaru Hasegawa

[The "Hentai" Prince and the Stony Cat]
    Viva, flat chests! — Youto Yokodera

    D-Does she have to make such lewd noises with each rep? — Youto Yokodera

    Hello, is this the police? I'd like to report a loli-pedo hybrid pervert in the neighborhood. — Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi

    You are, to the very last second of the very last cut of the very last episode... a Hentai-san, Senpai. — Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi

    It's hard to make girls smile when you're older too, but make sure you never make a girl cry. — Youto Yokodera

    Oh, I know! Why don't we play strippy-strip before we see your mom? — Youto Yokodera

    This man will now choose between life and death. Dead or Die. — Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi

    I'm not a Pervert I just Enjoy The Art Of Hentai . — Youto Yokodera

    Swimsuits are the best! Thank God for wedgies! — Youto Yokodera

    So, Pervert... Do your best to make enough for a soccer team. — Azusa Azuki

    Getting close to someone halfheartedly can cause you suffering. — Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi

    The deviant Irish writer I so love, Oscar Wilde, once said while imprisoned: "I don't regret for a single moment having lived for pleasure." Like, if there was a popularity poll about girls swimsuits, who'd win? I keep wondering about this eternal mystery of mankind every day. There're as many different swimsuits as stars in the sky, but the ones the swimmers wear hold the most charm. — Youto Yokodera

    I want to keep making memories with you. Even if I'll just lose them, I want to stay right by you because I love you. — Youto Yokodera

    It's difficult to make a girl smile, even as a grown-up. But you should never, ever make a girl cry. And if you ever see a girl crying, help her. You might not be able to make her smile, but they'll know how you feel. — Youto Yokodera

    Communication is the only way people can move ahead. — Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi

    Buying into faceless rumors is the mark of a fool. — Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi

    His greatest wish is to make you bear his child! He wants to pour his thick white genetic fluids all over you in pure carnal ecstasy! Hey, how dare you make a girl say that? — Mai Maimaki

    Just die already! What are you waiting for? Go die! Die, then on the third day rise from the dead and die again! — Mai Maimaki

    If the statement "little sisters are cute" is true, and the statement "every cute girl is a little sister" is also true, then this becomes a tautology. Therefore, your little sister is cute. — Youto Yokodera

    Making one person happy may be different from making everyone happy. But I still don't want to make any girls cry. No matter what. — Youto Yokodera

    Why the shorts, President?! What happened to your usual tights? This ruins the binding teen fetishism! Take those off right away and change into tights! You're so inconsiderate! — Youto Yokodera

    What'll happen to us if no help comes? Will we have to be the Adam and Eve of this place? I'll do my best! So you should work hard enough to make a soccer team! — Azusa Azuki

    You don't have to worry! Of course I like well-proportioned girls, but there are people who think a flat chest is a wonderful status symbol! Not to mention that if you're flat, you don't need to bother with bras! And they won't ever sag either, since there's nothing to sag in the first place! Isn't that wonderful, Flatty? — Youto Yokodera

    Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. Trash to the trashcan. Hopeless people to the hopeless box. — Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi

    While it's important to show how you truly feel, you shouldn't just discard your facade entirely. Why don't you try wearing some other mask? If you're gonna put one on, try wearing a nicer one. Not the scary one you've got on now. — Youto Yokodera

    I see. Now either figuratively bite your tongue and shut up, or literally bite your tongue and die. — Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi

    Sometimes getting only a little closer makes things harder. — Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi

[Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They?]
    True art requires your imagination for the unknown. It demands you seek out the mysterious. Yes, the best art is that which exists in your own universe within yourself. The contents of a maiden's skirt is no different. When you can see, all you're left with are vulgar panties, but if you can't see a thing, it is art! — Shiroyasha

    It's art if I can't see anything?! — Izayoi Sakamaki

    That's quite an interesting way to provoke someone. — Izayoi Sakamaki

[Usigi Drop]
    Boys are notoriously childish but, I can empathize. — Daikichi

    Daikichi, are you gonna die before me? — Rin

    Daikichi Should Stay Daikichi — Rin Kaga

    It's dangerous if we don't hold hands — Rin Kaga

    It's getting to the point where I'm losing track of whether I'm raising Rin, or whether she's raising me. — Daikichi Kawachi

    Girls always have a heavy load to bear. — Haruko
